Reading this Chart
#: represents chance in 30 of settlement having this type of supplier
1/#: represents a fractional chance in thirty of settlement having this type of supplier (e.g., “1/3” = one-third of a chance in 30)
where “1/2” = 1 in 60 chance (if a 1 is rolled on 1d30, a result of 1-15 on an additional 1d30 = a positive result),
and “1/3” = 1 in 90 chance (if a 1 is rolled on 1d30, a result of 1-10 on an additional 1d30 = a positive result)
(#): indicates community has at least one supplier of this type; number in parentheses indicates chance in 30 of community having a second supplier of same type
[#]: indicates a total range of suppliers of this type (e.g., “[2-3]” indicates community has 2-3 suppliers of this type.
†† assumes a proximity to water; otherwise chance in 30 at DM’s discretion
